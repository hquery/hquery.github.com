        <div class="term">Adaptor</div>
          <p>A software abstraction that allows classes of information (objects or instances) to work together that normally could not because of incompatible interfaces. By providing its interface to clients while using the original interface, the adapter translates calls to its interface into calls to the original interface, and the amount of code necessary to do this is typically small. The adapter is also responsible for transforming data into appropriate forms.</p>

There is also a "Reduce" step in this framework, where the master node then takes the answers to all the sub-problems and combines them in some way to get the output, the answer to the problem it was originally trying to solve.</p>
