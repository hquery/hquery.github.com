          <div class="question">Adaptor</div>
          A software abstraction that allows classes of information (objects or instances) to work together that normally could not because of incompatible interfaces. By providing its interface to clients while using the original interface, the adapter translates calls to its interface into calls to the original interface, and the amount of code necessary to do this is typically small. The adapter is also responsible for transforming data into appropriate forms.

          <div class="question">Map Reduce</div>
          A framework for processing large datasets on certain kinds of distributable problems using a large number of computers referred to as nodes. The framework supports two steps, a "Map" step where the master node takes the input, partitions it up into smaller sub-problems, and distributes those to worker nodes. A worker node may do this again in turn, leading to a multi-level tree structure. The worker node processes that smaller problem, and passes the answer back to its master node. There is also a "Reduce" step in this framework, where the master node then takes the answers to all the sub-problems and combines them in some way to get the output, the answer to the problem it was originally trying to solve.
