<dl class="table-display">
	<dt>Adaptor</dt>
    	<dd>A software abstraction that allows classes of information (objects or instances) to work together that normally could not because of incompatible interfaces. By providing its interface to clients while using the original interface, the adapter translates calls to its interface into calls to the original interface, and the amount of code necessary to do this is typically small. The adapter is also responsible for transforming data into appropriate forms.</dd>

    <dt>HITSP/C32 (C32)</dt>
          <dd>A constrained profile of the CCD that is intended to simplify implementation and improve interoperability. There is no normative schema for the C32. Note that HITSP has recently split up C32 into HITSP/C80 and HITSP/C83.</dd>
    <dt>HHS</dt>
          <dd>The United States Department of Health and Human Services. This is a Cabinet department of the United States government with the goal of protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services.</dd>
    <dt>HIE</dt>
          <dd>Health Information Exchange is defined as the mobilization of healthcare information electronically across organizations within a region, community or hospital system. HIE is an integral component of the health information technology (HIT) infrastructure under development in the United States and the associated National Health Information Network (NHIN).</dd>
    <dt>HITSP</dt>
          <dd>Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel. The American National Standards Institute Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel was created in 2005 as part of efforts by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology to promote interoperability in healthcare by harmonizing health information technology standards.</dd>
    <dt>HIT</dt>
          <dd>Healthcare Information Technology or Health Informatics. This is the intersection of information science, computer science and health care. It deals with the resources, devices and methods required to optimize the acquisition, storage, retrieval and use of information in health and biomedicine.</dd>
    <dt>HL7</dt>
          <dd>Health Level Seven is an all-volunteer, not-for-profit organization involved in development of international healthcare standards.</dd>
    <dt>HTTP</dt>
          <dd>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is a networking protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.</dd>
    <dt>JavaScript</dt>
          <dd>A prototype-based, object-oriented scripting language that is dynamic, weakly typed and has first-class functions. It is also considered a functional programming language.</dd>
    <dt>JSON</dt>
          <dd>JavaScript Object Notation is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, which includes C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and others.</dd>
    <dt>Laika</dt>
          <dd><a href="http://projectlaika.org">Laika</a> is an open source electronic health record (EHR) testing framework that was designed and developed by <a href="http://www.mitre.org" target="_external">the MITRE Corporation</a>.  Laika analyzes and reports on the interoperability capabilities of EHR systems. This includes the testing for certification of EHR software products and networks.  To support EHR data interoperability testing, Laika is designed to verify the input and output of EHR data against nationally recognized data and transport standards.</dd>
    <dt>Map Reduce</dt>
          <dd>A framework for processing large datasets on certain kinds of distributable problems using a large number of computers referred to as nodes. The framework supports two steps, a "Map" step where the master node takes the input, partitions it up into smaller sub-problems, and distributes those to worker nodes. A worker node may do this again in turn, leading to a multi-level tree structure. The worker node processes that smaller problem, and passes the answer back to its master node. There is also a "Reduce" step in this framework, where the master node then takes the answers to all the sub-problems and combines them in some way to get the output, the answer to the problem it was originally trying to solve.</dd>
	<dt>MITRE</dt>
          <dd>The MITRE Corporation is a not-for-profit organization chartered to work in the public interest.

          <dd>A collection of standards, protocols, legal agreements, specifications, and services that enables the secure exchange of health information over the internet. The NHIN is a key component of the nationwide health information technology strategy and will provide a common platform for health information exchange across diverse entities, within communities and across the country, helping to achieve the goals of the HITECH Act.</dd>
    <dt>ONC</dt>
          <dd>The Office of the National Coordinator for Healthcare Information Technology. ONC is at the forefront of the administrationâ€™s health IT efforts and is a resource to the entire health system to support the adoption of health information technology and the promotion of nationwide health information exchange to improve health care. ONC is organizationally located within the Office of the Secretary for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).</dd>
    <dt>Ruby</dt>
          <dd>A reflective, dynamic, object-oriented programming language. It combines syntax inspired by Perl with Smalltalk-like object-oriented features, and also shares some features with Python, Lisp, Dylan, and CLU. Ruby is a single-pass interpreted language.</dd>
